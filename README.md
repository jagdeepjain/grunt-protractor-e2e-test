grunt-protractor-e2e-test
=========================
Sample code for starting up browser testing using protractor and grunt.

pre-requisite
=============
For running protractor tests, we need to install grunt-cli and protractor:

```
npm install -g grunt-cli
```

Above command will install grunt-cli for all users. You can choose if you just want for the current project using --save-dev command.

Navigate to your project directory and execute below command:

```
npm install protractor  --save-dev
```

Above command will install protractor in your project.


once these are installed, navigate to node_modules/grunt-protractor-runner/node_modules/protractor/bin you will see webdriver-manager, execute below command:

```
node webdriver-manager update
```

Above steps will selenium dependencies including webdriver which is required to run selenium tests. It will create a directory by name selenium inside under protractor directory and download chromedriver driver and selenium stand alone server based on protractor version.

running test
============

Now we can run test:

```
grunt test:e2e
```

Chrome browser will launch and test will execute.
